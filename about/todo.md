# Customizing This Site

> When you are done with customizing your site, you can delete this file.

These instructions will get you started in customizing this repository for your classroom organization. This repository uses the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)-based static site generator along with Travis.ci for continuous deployment.

## Renaming Placeholder Text

This template has a number of placeholder text items that you can quickly customize using a search/replace in all files. Assuming you are using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your editor, you can press [[ctrl]] + [[shift]] + [[h]] to perform your search/replace. The following placeholder text items should be changed to fit with your site.

- `DMIT-0001` - replace with your classroom organization's name
- `Name_of_Course` - replace with the name of your course
